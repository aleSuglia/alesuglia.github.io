#       I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

#     summary: |
#       Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

Alessandro Suglia is an Assistant Professor at Heriot-Watt University (HWU) and co-lead of the "Generative AI for Robotics" theme at the National Robotarium. I am also a member of the ELLIS network and the academic liaison between HWU and the Alan Turing Institute.

Alessandro’s research focuses on designing artificial agents that learn language by leveraging sensory information derived from interacting with the world and with other agents. During his PhD, he was one of the main developers of Alana, the Heriot-Watt conversational AI which ranked 3rd in the Amazon Alexa Prize challenge in 2018. In his role as Assistant Professor at HWU, he led the HWU team “EMMA”, the only non-American university team which was one of the finalists of the Amazon Simbot Challenge—the first Amazon competition to push the boundaries of Embodied Conversational AI. Alongside several academic collaborations, he also completed research collaborations with Amazon Alexa AI, Meta AI, and the European Space Agency focused on developing innovative Multimodal Generative AI models for embodied and situated human-robot interaction tasks.
