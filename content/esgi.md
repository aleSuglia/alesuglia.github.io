        Inspired by [Barsalou's Grounded Cognition theory](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17705682/), our research group focuses on designing artificial agents that learn language by leveraging sensory information derived from interacting with the world and with other agents. We explore the intersection of natural language processing, computer vision, robotics, and cognitive science to develop AI systems that can understand and interact with their environment in meaningful ways. 

        Our work spans multiple domains including:
        - **Embodied AI**: Developing agents that can perceive and act in physical environments
        - **Situated Language Understanding**: Creating systems that understand language in context
        - **Grounded Intelligence**: Building AI that connects language to real-world experiences
        - **Human-Robot Interaction**: Designing conversational AI for embodied applications
        - **Multimodal Learning**: Integrating vision, language, and action for comprehensive understanding
